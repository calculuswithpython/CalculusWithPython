### This repository hosts the project of developing Calculus content with a computer (Python) friendly approach and integrated to other media, like youtube. My purpose is to introduce the content through shorter videos and to encourage the exploration of the concepts of calculus with Python.

This interactive book aims to give a modern and straightforward presentation of several classical topics in vector calculus. The interactive book features code that runs on the pages, associated videos on YouTube, and content made to work on many different devices.

The material is developed using an XML vocabulary for research articles, textbooks, and monographs called PreTeXt (https://pretextbook.org/) and it's code cells are running a Python based mathematics software system called Sagemath (https://www.sagemath.org/).

If you have any suggestion, comment correction or would like to contact Calculus with Python, please write to calculuswithpython[at]gmail.comðŸ‘‹
